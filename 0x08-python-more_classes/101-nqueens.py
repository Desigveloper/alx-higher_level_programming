"""
Solves the N queens problem by placing N non-attacking queens on an
NÃ—N chessboard.

Usage: nqueens N

Args:
    N (int): The size of the chessboard and the number of queens to be placed.
Returns:
    None

Raises:
    ValueError: If the user called the program with the wrong number
    of arguments, or if N is not a positive integer greater or equal to 4.

Prints:
    Every possible solution to the N queens problem, one solution per line.
    The format of each solution is as follows:
        - Each line represents a row on the chessboard.
        - The number on each line represents the column where the
        queen is placed in that row.
        - The numbering of the columns starts from 0.

Imports:
    sys: The sys module is imported to handle command line arguments.
